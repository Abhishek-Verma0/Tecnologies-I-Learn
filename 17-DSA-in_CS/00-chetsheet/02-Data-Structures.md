## Data Structures
Data Structures are a fundamental element of computer science. They provide a specific way to organize and store data so that it can be accessed and used efficiently. Different types of data structures include arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, hash tables, trees, and graphs. Each of these has its unique characteristics and use-cases, and is optimal for certain kinds of operations. For example, arrays are excellent for random access, while linked lists work well for frequent insertions and deletions. The correct choice of data structure can significantly enhance the performance of your programs.

## Importance of Data Structures
Data structures are crucial in the field of computer science and coding because they offer a method of organizing and storing data in an efficient and manageable format. They’re critical because they form the foundation for modern algorithm design. Your ability to choose or design the most suited data structure for a particular task can be the difference between a solution that’s functional and efficient and one that isn’t. They allow data to be processed in a variety of ways - stored, sorted, ordered, or accessed - which is integral to software or database development. By implementing effective data structures, programmers can enhance performance, ease coding procedures, allow flexibility of data and most importantly, reduce complexity of code in a significant manner. Markdown offers the advantage of clear, straightforward formatting to express these concepts.

## Basic Data Structures
The five main types of basic data structures are: Arrays, Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues, and Hash Tables.

- Arrays are static data structures that store elements of the same type in contiguous memory locations.
- Linked Lists are dynamic data structures that store elements in individual nodes, with each node pointing to the next.
- Stacks follow the Last-In-First-Out principle (LIFO) and primarily assist in function calls in most programming languages.Mainly three basic operations are performed in the stack:

Push: adds an element to the collection.

Pop: removes an element from the collection. A pop can result in stack underflow if the stack is empty.

Peek or Top: returns the top item without removing it from the stack.

- Queues operate on the First-In-First-Out principle (FIFO) and are commonly used in task scheduling.

- Lastly, Hash Tables store key-value pairs allowing for fast insertion, deletion, and search operations.
Hash Tables are specialized data structures that allow fast access to data based on a key. Essentially, a hash table works by taking a key input, and then computes an index into an array in which the desired value can be found. It uses a hash function to calculate this index. Suppose the elements are integers and the hash function returns the value at the unit’s place. If the given key is 22, it will check the value at index 2. Collisions occur when the hash function returns the same output for two different inputs. There are different methods to handle these collisions such as chaining and open addressing.
