## Programming Fundamentals
Programming Fundamentals are the basic concepts and principles that form the foundation of any computer programming language. These include understanding variables, which store data for processing, control structures such as loops and conditional statements that direct the flow of a program, data structures which organize and store data efficiently, and algorithms which step by step instructions to solve specific problems or perform specific tasks. Mastery of these fundamentals forms the basis for learning any specific programming language and for writing efficient, effective code.

## Control Structures
Control structures are fundamental elements in most programming languages that facilitate the flow of control through a program. There are three main types of control structures: Sequential, Selection and Iteration. Sequential control structures are the default mode where instructions happen one after another. Selection control structures (often called “conditional” or “decision” structures) allow one set of instructions to be executed if a condition is true and another if it’s false. These typically include if...else statements. Iteration control structures (also known as “loops”) allow a block of code to be repeated multiple times. Common loop structures include for, while, and do...while loops. All these control structures play a vital role in shaping the program logic.

## Functions
Functions in programming are named sections of a program that perform a specific task. They allow us to write a piece of code once and reuse it in different places throughout the program, making our code more modular and easier to maintain. Functions often take in input, do something with it, and return output. Functions can be categorized into four main types: built-in functions (like print(), provided by the programming language), user-defined functions (written by the user for a specific use case), anonymous functions (also known as lambda functions, which are not declared using the standard def keyword), and higher-order functions (functions that take other functions as arguments or return a function).

## OOP Basics
Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that uses “objects” to design applications and software. In OOP, each object is an instance of a class. A class defines the properties (often known as attributes or fields) and methods (actions) that are common to all objects of a certain kind. A key principle of OOP is the ability to hide certain parts of the objects’ data from the outside, a concept known as encapsulation. Other key principles are inheritance, a way to form new classes using classes that have already been defined, and polymorphism, the concept of designing objects to share behaviors and being able to override shared behaviors with specifics.


## Pseudo Code
Pseudo code is a plain language description of the steps in an algorithm or another system. It is intended for human reading rather than machine reading. Pseudo code often uses control structures and terms common to popular high-level programming languages without strictly adhering to the syntax of any particular one. The foremost aim of pseudocode is to explain the inner “algorithmic thinking” behind coding, rather than focusing on the syntax of a particular language. A nice feature of pseudocode is that it is largely able to be understood by a wider range of people than the corresponding code in a specific programming language, which enhances its roles in drafting, documentation, learning, and collaboration aspects.
