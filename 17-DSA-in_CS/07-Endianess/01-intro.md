## Endianess
Endianess is the order in which bytes are stored in memory. The two most common types of endianess are big endian and little endian. Big endian stores the most significant byte first, while little endian stores the least significant byte first.

Endianness is represented two ways Big-endian (BE) and Little-endian (LE).

- BE stores the big-end first. When reading multiple bytes the first byte (or the lowest memory address) is the biggest - so it makes the most sense to people who read left to right.
- LE stores the little-end first. When reading multiple bytes the first byte (or the lowest memory address) is the littlest -  so it makes most sense to people who read right to left.
