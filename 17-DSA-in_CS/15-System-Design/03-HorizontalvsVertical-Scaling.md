## What is scalability?
The scalability of an application can be measured by the number of requests it can effectively support simultaneously. The point at which an application can no longer handle additional requests effectively is the limit of its scalability. This limit is reached when a critical hardware resource runs out, requiring different or more machines. Scaling these resources can include any combination of adjustments to CPU and physical memory (different or more machines), hard disk (bigger hard drives, less “live” data, solid state drives), and/or the network bandwidth (multiple network interface controllers, bigger NICs, fiber, etc.).

Scaling horizontally and scaling vertically are similar in that they both involve adding computing resources to your infrastructure. There are distinct differences between the two in terms of implementation and performance.

Horizontal scaling is the process of adding more machines to your system. This is also known as scaling out. Vertical scaling is the process of adding more power to a single machine. This is also known as scaling up.
