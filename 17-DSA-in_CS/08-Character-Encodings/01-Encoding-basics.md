Character encodings are a way of representing characters as numbers. They are used to store and transmit text. The most common character encoding is ASCII, which is a 7-bit encoding. This means that each character is represented by a number between 0 and 127. The ASCII character set contains 128 characters, including letters, numbers, punctuation, and control characters. The ASCII character set is a subset of the Unicode charUnicode is a standard for encoding characters acter set, which is a 16-bit encoding. Unicode is a superset of ASCII, so ASCII characters can be represented by Unicode. Unicode is the most common character encoding used on the web.
## Unicode
Unicode is a standard for encoding characters. It is a superset of ASCII, which means that ASCII is a subset of Unicode. Unicode is a 16-bit encoding, which means that it can encode 2^16 = 65536 characters. This is a lot more than ASCII, which can only encode 128 characters.
An example character set is Unicode. Here is part of its code point mapping (note that code points are traditionally written in hex):

Because characters can have multiple glyphs, Unicode lets you represent characters unambiguously with U+ followed by four to six hex digits (e.g. U+00C9, U+1D122).

## ASCII
ASCII is a character set that is exactly equivalent to the first 128 mappings of Unicode. Obviously it doesnâ€™t have enough characters. However it is commonly used, because many Internet protocols require it! It is a common subset of many character sets and something most people can agree on.
