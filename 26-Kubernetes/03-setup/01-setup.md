## Setting Up Kubernetes
To set up a Kubernetes cluster, you need to choose a deployment environment, install Kubernetes components on each node, configure networking using a plugin, initialize the master node with kubeadm init, join worker nodes using kubeadm join, deploy applications with manifests, and manage the cluster using kubectl or a management tool.
