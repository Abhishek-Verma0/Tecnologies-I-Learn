## Design
The UI and UX in a design system need to be tied to development as much as possible. The tools in this checklist should help designers and developers work better together.

## Design Editor
There are many design editors available in the market today with the most popular names being Sketch, Figma and Adobe XD. If you’re unsure which route to go down it’s often best to speak with your team.
## Plugins
Most popular Design Editors (Sketch and Figma, especially) come with third-party plugin support. Whilst it’s best to use the editors in-built tools for laying out your components, plugins can bring in a range of useful data to populate them.
## Version Control
Having your design versioned with semantic versioning will allow you to easily align design with development, roll back faulty changes and release changes in code and design at the same time.
