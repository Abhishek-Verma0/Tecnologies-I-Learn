## Component Catalog
Isolate your UI components’ environment outside of your product codebase to make sure they’re not dependent on any global dependencies and can be easily reused.

## Documentation
Having your code documented is key to driving adoption and reducing the load on the contributors.

## Code Style
Having a defined code style helps align the way code’s written in the system and increases development velocity. It should be automated with the tools provided for each platform.

## Unit Testing
Every part of the design system should be covered with unit tests. Once your system’s adopted, any change in the isolated environment may affect how the product works.

## Accessibility Testing
Design systems should cover accessibility as much as possible. Making this automatic reduces the risk of inaccessible components or user flows in the product.

## Semantic Versioning
Version your code with semantic versioning that dictates how version numbers are assigned and incremented.

## Release Strategy
Design system releases should be automated and ideally use scripts ran locally or in remote CI pipelines to prevent broken releases.
