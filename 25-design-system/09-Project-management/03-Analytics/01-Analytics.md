## Analytics
Data isn’t the only driving factor when it comes to the development of design systems. Keeping a sharp eye on how your system’s used in the development process and the end product can inform your go-forward strategy.

## Component Analytics
Track the usage of your components. For development you can use built-in tools like Figma’s Design System Analytics. For the end product you can have a separate way of tracking per platform depending on the technology

## Error Logging
Implement a way to track and pinpoint component-related outages in your product.

## Tooling Analytics
Track what tools are being used for your design system. Find out which ones are used the most and which features are the most popular.

## Service and Health Metrics
Define service and health metrics for your design system to set a benchmark on how well you’re doing. Common examples can be the number of tickets closed, improvements made or bugs fixed.
