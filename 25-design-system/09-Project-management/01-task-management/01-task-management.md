## Task Management
Solid task management and workflows are a crucial step in executing any project. Adopting a methodology like Agile or Kanban helps you cover a lot of ground.

## Roadmap
Setting your short and long term vision and mapping things out helps you decide the steps to take, understand your place in the bigger picture and prioritise day-to-day tasks.

## Milestones
Define milestones that act as bigger epics in your project management with the help of your roadmap. These will help you understand your progress.

## Ticketing
Make it easier to track your day-to-day progress by using ticketing software like Jira, Trello or GitHub. Thisâ€™ll make it easier for others to submit feature proposals or bug reports.
