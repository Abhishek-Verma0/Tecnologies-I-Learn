## Community Meetings
Arrange community meetings with everyone who uses the design system. Share your knowledge and make proposals to improve the sense of community.
## Communication Channel
Most product development work happens digitally, so create a digital channel where people can reach out and ask questions.
## Open Hours
Create open hours in which you can engage your audience in a more private setting where you can discuss things in more detail. You can also use these as peer coding or peer design opportunities.
