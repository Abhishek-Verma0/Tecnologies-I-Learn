## Why Use a Design System?
Design systems, when implemented well, can provide a lot of benefits to a design team:

- Design (and development) work can be created and replicated quickly and at scale.
- The primary benefit of design systems is their ability to replicate designs quickly by utilizing premade UI components and elements. Teams can continue to use the same elements over and over, reducing the need to reinvent the wheel and thus risking unintended inconsistency.
- It alleviates strain on design resources to focus on larger, more complex problems.
- Since simpler UI elements are created already and reusable, design resources can focus less on tweaking visual appearance and more on more-complex problems (like information prioritization, workflow optimization, and journey management). While this payoff might seem small when you create only a small number of screens, it becomes substantial when you must coordinate efforts across dozens of teams and thousands of screens.
- It creates a unified language within and between crossfunctional teams.
- Especially when design responsibilities shift or when teams become geographically dispersed, a unified language reduces wasted design or development time around miscommunications. For example, the functionality or appearance of a dropdown menu would not be debated, since that term is reserved for a specifically defined element within the design system.
- It creates visual consistency across products, channels, and (potentially siloed) departments.
- Particularly when teams work in silos, where each product or channel operates independently of the others, the absence of an organization-wide design system can lead to inconsistent visual appearance and  experiences that seem fragmented or unrelated to the brand. Design systems provide a single source of components, patterns, and styles and unify disjointed experiences so that they are visually cohesive and appear to be part of the same ecosystem. As an added bonus, any major visual rebrands or redesigns can be managed at scale through the design system.
- It can serve as an educational tool and reference for junior-level designers and content contributors. 
- Explicitly written usage guidelines and style guides help onboard individual contributors who are new to UI design or content creation and also serve as a reminder for the rest of the contributors.

### Stakeholders
Building an effective design system is not an individual responsibility, you need more than just designers. Hereâ€™s a quick list of the disciplines that can be represented in your team to create an effective design system:

- Designers: to define the visual elements of the system
- Frontend Developers: To create modular efficient code
- Accessibility Experts: Accessibility experts to ensure your system conforms to standards like WCAG
- Performance Experts: who can ensure your system loads quickly on all devices
- Content Strategists: who can help the team nail the voice and tone of the system
- Researchers: who can help you understand customer needs
- Product Managers: to ensure the system is aligning to customer needs
- Leaders: (VPs and directors) to champion and align the vision throughout the company including up to executive leadership
