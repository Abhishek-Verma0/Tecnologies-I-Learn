## Component
Components are the reusable building blocks of a design system. Each component meets a specific interaction or UI needs, and is specifically created to work together to create patterns and intuitive user experiences.
## Component Library
A component library is a collection of all the components used in a website, software or app.

## Design Language
A design language or design vocabulary is an overarching scheme or style that guides the design of a complement of products or architectural settings, creating a coherent design system for styling.

The term “design language” describes the overall visual design of a digital product. It creates a bridge between wireframing and visual design. The functional role of the design language system is to help users perceive and comprehend visible signs, but it also has a direct impact on the overall experience users have when they interact with a product.

### Design language vs. design systems
Is a design language and a design system the same thing? The answer is no. Well-defined design systems are based on implementation details (tools and technologies), design language, and culture (values, principles, and practices). Design language is an integral part of a design system, which helps a team to understand not only how to use components and styles together to create a consistent user interface, but it also communicates why they need to use those components and styles in the first place.

A design language will cover many facets of a product, including but not limited to:

- Colors
- Fonts
- Icons
- Sounds
- Spacing and layouts
- Copy
- Graphic design and illustrations
- Data visualizations
- States

### Governance
Governance is a framework for clarifying roles, responsibilities, and authority over decisions. Having that clarity ensures that decisions for the design system funnel smoothly through the governance process

Design system governance fulfills several purposes:

- Maintain’s design and brand consistency
- Prevents poor design decisions—leading to usability issues
- Encourages team members to think creatively and try to solve problems with the tools on hand before attempting to make changes
- Ensures updates consider accessibility
- Keeps the entire organization informed of changes
- Updates digital product and design documentation

A Step-by-Step Governance Model Example
There are many ways to approach design system governance, but here is a 10-step process inspired by design system guru Brad Frost:

- Use what’s available – Product teams must exhaust every effort to find a solution using the current component library. This means a design system must be well documented and accessible to everyone. If the current design system does not fulfill the new requirement, teams can proceed to step two.
- Contact design system (DS) team – Product teams contact the DS team to discuss the problem and the proposed changes. Again, the DS team and product team will work together to find an existing solution. With intimate knowledge of the design system, the DS team might uncover something the product team missed. If there is still no solution, teams proceed to step three.
- Determine if the change is one-off or part of the design system – The product team and DS team decide whether the amendment is a one-off (snowflake) or part of the design system. One-off changes usually fall on the product team, while the DS team handles design system changes. Either way, teams must prioritize and schedule the changes.
- Initial Prototyping – Teams prototype and test product changes.
- Initial Review Process – The DS team and product team review the results from prototyping and testing. If both teams are satisfied, they proceed to the next step. If they determine the changes are lacking, teams return to prototyping and testing.
- UX & Dev Testing – Once designs pass the initial review, they go to UX and development teams for further testing to ensure the changes meet user experience and technical requirements.
- Final review – The product team and DS team meet again to review the results of UX and dev testing. If both teams are satisfied, they proceed to the next step. If not, they iterate.
- Documentation and schedule release – Teams document the new changes, update the changelog (e.g., Github), and schedule the release.
- Changes released – Changes are released, product version bump according to versioning guidelines, all teams notified (Slack, Asana, Trello, Github, etc.).
- Quality assurance – Product teams review the final changes for quality assurance.
### Guidelines
Design guidelines are sets of recommendations on how to apply design principles to provide a positive user experience. Designers use such guidelines to judge how to adopt principles such as intuitiveness, learnability, efficiency and consistency so they can create compelling designs and meet and exceed user needs.
### Pattern
Patterns are best practice design solutions for specific user-focused tasks and page types. Patterns often use one or more components and explain how to adapt them to the context. Some sample patterns could be user signing in to the application or performing the checkout operation.
### Pilot
Pilots are one of the best ways to put your design system through its paces, especially before the design system even gets to a v1. Like television pilots help test audience reactions to a series concept without investing significant resources to create the whole thing, application pilots are a good foundation for ensuring your design system’s design and code are battle-tested.
### Token
Design system tokens are the style values of UI elements such as color, typography, spacing, shadows, etc., that are used across products and capable of being converted to a format for any platform (web, mobile, desktop). Tokens are building blocks of the design system—think of them as sub atoms, the smallest pieces of style values that allow designers to create styles for a product.
### UI Kit
As it relates to a design system, a UI Kit is a representation of coded components created in a way that designers who don’t know code can create interface mockups. Examples of UI kits are Sketch libraries and Figma design systems.
