## Design Language
A design language or design vocabulary is an overarching scheme or style that guides the design of a complement of products or architectural settings, creating a coherent design system for styling.

The term “design language” describes the overall visual design of a digital product. It creates a bridge between wireframing and visual design. The functional role of the design language system is to help users perceive and comprehend visible signs, but it also has a direct impact on the overall experience users have when they interact with a product.

### Design language vs. design systems
Is a design language and a design system the same thing? The answer is no. Well-defined design systems are based on implementation details (tools and technologies), design language, and culture (values, principles, and practices). Design language is an integral part of a design system, which helps a team to understand not only how to use components and styles together to create a consistent user interface, but it also communicates why they need to use those components and styles in the first place.
