## Color
Not only an efficient way to showcase your brand, but also an efficient way to communicate with your users. Colour palettes created with purpose over aesthetics in mind can help you create intuitive design patterns by adding meaning to your interface.

### Accessibility
Make sure to have accessible pairings between the main colours in your palette. More importantly, make sure that your background and text colours have at least an AA standard contrast ratio between them.
### Functional Colors
Besides your brand colours, make sure to have colours defined and made into variables for functions like disabled states, backgrounds, actions and high contrast text.
### Dark Mode
Preparing a dark mode version of your colour palette will allow your design system to adapt to dark mode and respect what your user wants to see.

### Guidelines
Provide guidelines on how and when to use the colours in your palette, what to keep in mind when working with them and how not to use them.
