## Typography
Typography is one of the main ways you surface content in products. A clear hierarchy and contrasting styles in your typography scale will make things easier to read and help with the overall structure of your product. Itâ€™s also an opportunity to visualise your brand character and presence.
### Responsiveness
Desktop devices can usually afford to have bigger font sizes compared to mobile devices. Creating a typography scale that adapts to the viewport size will help with a more meaningful hierarchy and layout.
### Grid Relation
Font sizes and leading should match your grid to allow better pairing between text and other UI elements. A good example of this is text paired with icons with bounding boxes.
### Readability
Optimising the letter spacing (tracking), line height (leading) and line length for your typography scale will help with the readability of text.
### Performance
Custom fonts need to be downloaded before they can be displayed, especially on the web. Make sure that you have sensible fallbacks and fast loading time for your typography assets. Using system fonts solves this performance problem.
