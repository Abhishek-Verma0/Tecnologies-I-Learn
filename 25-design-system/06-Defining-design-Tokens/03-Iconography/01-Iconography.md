## Iconography
Icons are symbols that represent functionality or content. They’re especially recognisable and helpful in user interfaces since their meaning can be understood at a glance. hough they can be used just for decoration, their full potential can be realised when they’re used meaningfully and consistently.
### Accessibility
For icons that convey a meaning or serve a function, add the necessary support for screen readers. You can skip this for decorative icons.
### Style
Make sure that your icon family makes visual sense as a whole. Picking an outlined or filled style and sticking with it will lead to better visual consistency and predictability.
### Naming
Name your icons based on what they are, not what they represent. For instance, a trash icon should be named trash, not delete. You can still add related keywords to improve discoverability.
### Grid Relation
Draw your icons in a bounding box that plays well with your grid. This makes for a better pairing with other UI elements. A good example of this would be icons with bounding boxes paired with text.
### Sizes
Provide different sizes for icons that correlate to your grid. Provide a minimum size and remove unnecessary detail for your icons for smaller sizes.

### Keywords
Adding keywords will improve the discoverability of each icon and provide a better user experience for anyone using your system.

### Reserved Icons
Reserving icons that represent common actions will prevent their use in any other context. System icons for navigation or adding and deleting are a good example. This leads to a more intuitive user experience.

### Guidelines
Provide guidelines on how and when to use icons, what to keep in mind when working with them and how not to use them.
