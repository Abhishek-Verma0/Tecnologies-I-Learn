## Layout
A well thought out layout goes a long way. Consistent use of a grid and spacing makes it easier for your users to scan the user interface and grasp the content.

### Units
Units are the most granular building blocks for layout. Defining a set of values with consistent increments (such as 4, 8, 12 and 16 for a 4-point system) will provide you with the foundation when youâ€™re designing your grid and spacing values.

### Grid
Every layout should sit on a grid that brings order and hierarchy to the interface. Define a grid separately for mobile, tablet and desktop devices with columns, gutters, and margins so your interface can adapt to any platform easily.

### Breakpoints
Predefine the screen sizes and orientations your grid will adapt to.

### Spacing
Horizontal and vertical rhythm plays a big role in a layout. You should provide easy methods for adding space between interface elements independent of your grid.
