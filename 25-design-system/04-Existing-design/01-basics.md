## Existing Design Analysis
First step in creating a design system from an existing design is performing a design analysis and understanding what you will be working with to identify the requirements and prepare a plan. Performing the analysis may consist of:

- Understanding the Existing Design Process
- Performing Visual Audit
- Identifying Design Elements
- Identify Common Components
- Understanding the A/B Testing and Experimentation Needs
- Understanding any Locale or regional requirements (such as LTR/RTL).
- Documenting your findings

To better understand the kind of design system you would like to implement, you need to start by reviewing and analyzing the current approach for design at your company. Find the answers to the following questions:

- What is the design process that your company follows?
- What are the existing tools that your company uses?
Itâ€™s also recommended to evaluate the level of design maturity of the product teams. This knowledge will help you estimate the time required to introduce the system to your organization.

## Visual Audit
Take screenshots of your current product with the help of your team. You can use any presentation software like Google Slides or print and pin them on foam-core boards. Group the screenshots into categories like buttons, navigation, forms, tables, charts, lists etc.

Now, review each category to find inconsistencies and note areas for improvement with your team. Use a tool like [CSS Stats](https://cssstats.com/) to see how many unique colors, typefaces you have in your style sheets.
