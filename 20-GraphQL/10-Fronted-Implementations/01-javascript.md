## Frontend Implementations
In GraphQL, the frontend refers to the client-side of the application, typically the web or mobile app that the end-user interacts with.

When using GraphQL on the frontend, developers can use a GraphQL client library, such as Apollo Client or Relay, to interact with the GraphQL server. These libraries provide a way to easily send GraphQL queries and mutations to the server and handle the response.

### Relay
[Relay](https://the-guild.dev/blog/graphql-codegen-relay-compiler) is a JavaScript framework that was developed by Facebook to build data-driven applications using GraphQL. It provides a set of tools and conventions that make it easier to build efficient and scalable applications that use GraphQL.

Relay is designed to work with GraphQL on the server and provides a set of client-side libraries for building client applications. It provides a set of components and hooks that make it easy to build efficient and scalable applications.

### Apollo Client
[Apollo Client](https://www.howtographql.com/react-apollo/0-introduction/) is a popular JavaScript library for building client applications that consume GraphQL APIs. It is developed and maintained by the Apollo team and is widely used in the industry.

Apollo Client provides a set of features that make it easy to interact with a GraphQL server, such as querying, mutating, and subscribing to data. It also provides a caching system to store the results of previous queries, which improves the performance of the application.

### URQL
[URQL](https://formidable.com/open-source/urql/) is a highly customizable and versatile GraphQL client with which you add on features like normalized caching as you grow. Itâ€™s built to be both easy to use for newcomers to GraphQL, and extensible, to grow to support dynamic single-app applications and highly customized GraphQL infrastructure.
