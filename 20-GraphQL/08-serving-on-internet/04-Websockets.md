## GraphQL Over Websockets
The WebSocket API is an advanced technology that makes it possible to open a two-way interactive communication session between the user’s browser and a server. With this API, you can send messages to a server and receive event-driven responses without having to poll the server for a reply.

### Authorization
Authorization in GraphQL refers to the process of controlling access to specific fields, types, or operations in a GraphQL schema based on user roles or permissions. It allows you to restrict access to certain data or functionality in your application based on the user’s role or permissions.

There are several ways to implement authorization in GraphQL:

Using middleware
Using schema directives
Using a data source layer

### Real Time
[Real-time](https://the-guild.dev/blog/subscriptions-and-live-queries-real-time-with-graphql) in GraphQL refers to the ability to receive real-time updates from a GraphQL server. This allows clients to receive updates from the server as soon as they occur, rather than having to periodically poll the server for new data.
