## Linkerd
Linkerd is an open source service mesh designed to be deployed into a variety of container schedulers and frameworks such as Kubernetes. It became the original “service mesh” when its creator Buoyant first coined the term in 2016. Like Twitter’s Finagle, on which it was based, Linkerd was first written in Scala and designed to be deployed on a per-host basis. Linkerd is one of the first products to be associated with the term service mesh and supports platforms such as Docker and Kubernetes.

### What is Linkerd?
Linkerd is an open source network proxy installed as a service mesh for Kubernetes. Linkerd, originally developed by Buoyant, was one of the first products to be associated with the term service mesh.

In IT, a service mesh is a dedicated infrastructure layer that controls service-to-service communication and enables separate parts of an application to communicate with each other. Service meshes are typically used in cloud-based applications, containers and microservices.

In a microservices application, managing communications across potentially hundreds of services can quickly become a complex task. Linkerd can serve as a cloud orchestration tool to secure communications among these services by providing features such as load balancing, service discovery, proxy integration and transparency, adaptive routing, failure recovery, circuit breaking, and instrumentation.
