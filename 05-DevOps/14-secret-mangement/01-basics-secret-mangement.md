## Secret Management
Secret management is an important aspect of DevOps, as it involves securely storing and managing sensitive information, such as passwords, API keys, and other secrets, that are used by applications and infrastructure.

There are several ways to manage secrets in a cloud environment:

- Secret stores: A secret store is a specialized database or service that is designed to securely store and manage secrets. Examples of secret stores include Hashicorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, and Google Cloud Secret Manager.
- Encryption: Secrets can be encrypted using a variety of encryption algorithms and protocols, such as AES, RSA, and PGP. Encrypted secrets can be stored in a variety of locations, such as a file system, a database, or a cloud storage service.
- Access controls: Access to secrets should be restricted to only those users or systems that need them, using techniques such as role-based access controls, multi-factor authentication, and least privilege principles.

Effective secret management is essential for maintaining the security and integrity of a DevOps environment. It is important to regularly review and update secret management practices to ensure that secrets are being stored and managed securely.

### Level 0: Hardcoding Secrets
Hardcoding secrets into your code is the worst option available. Although there are more extreme possibilities, such as turning off authentication completely, it’s still considered the worst practice for secret management. At this level, you place your password directly in the code where it’s needed.
```
For example, if you were building a Node.js app with a MongoDB database, you could put your password in the following line:

const dbClient = new MongoClient(process.env.MONGODB_URI, {
  useNewUrlParser: true,
  useUnifiedTopology: true,
  auth: {
    user: 'admin',
    password: 'mypassword',
  },
});
```
However, this is a really bad idea. Some of the biggest drawbacks include:

Private information is scattered throughout the codebase, making it difficult to return to it later and modify.
Even if the Git repository is private, all of the developers working on the project will have to clone the repository and store a copy of their secret on their system.
It’s difficult to support multiple environments, such as having a separate development, staging or production environment.
### Level 1: Extract Secrets into Separate Configuration Files
At this level, we create a config.env file containing the database password. We then use something like the dotenv package to load the secret as an environment variable. This is the preferred way to store secrets for development credentials. But, for production credentials, it’s not quite as secure.
```
// config.env
DATABASE_PASSWORD = mypassword
DATABASE_USER = admin

// app.js
const dbClient = new MongoClient(process.env.MONGODB_URI, {
  useNewUrlParser: true,
  useUnifiedTopology: true,
  auth: { 
    user: process.env.DATABASE_USER, 
    password: process.env.DATABASE_PASSWORD 
  },
});
```
The benefits of extracting the secrets into a separate configuration file include:

Clearer code without secret strings floating around throughout the project.
Having separate configuration files for different environments is possible.
You’ll know where all the secrets are, and we can adjust our behavior accordingly.
### Level 2: Encrypt before Checking them into the Repository
If it’s required to store secrets in the repository, then you can at least encrypt the secret files. For example, use OpenSSL to convert plain-text configuration files into encrypted files.
```
openssl aes-256-cbc -in mypassword.txt -out mypassword.txt.enc
```
Although this method is better than hardcoding secrets, the encryption key then becomes a sensitive secret itself. You’ll need to keep the encryption key secure.

### Level 3: Use a Dedicated Secret Manager
The advantage of utilizing a dedicated secret manager, like the one provided by your cloud provider, is the ability to manage secrets in a single location. Secrets can be audited so you can track who has accessed each secret, and they can also have multiple versions.

Many cloud providers offer a key management system that managers encryption keys securely. For example, Google Cloud secret manager or AWS Secrets Manager.

The secrets are retrieved as follows:
```
gcloud secrets versions access latest --secret=my-secret
```
### Level 4: Use Ephemeral Credentials with HashiCorp Vault
The best option for secure secret management is to use HashiCorp Vault with ephemeral credentials. This level ensures the secrets are only valid for a limited amount of time.

Vault generates new usernames and passwords for each requested resource. When the resource is no longer needed, then the username and password will be revoked automatically.

The process is automated with an API request, so the entire task is seamlessly managed by your applications automatically. To make this system work, you can use one of the HashiCorp Vault clients, such as the Node.js library.
