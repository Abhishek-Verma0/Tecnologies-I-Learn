## Cloud Providers
Cloud providers provide a layer of APIs to abstract infrastructure and provision it based on security and billing boundaries. The cloud runs on servers in data centers, but the abstractions cleverly give the appearance of interacting with a single “platform” or large application. The ability to quickly provision, configure and secure resources with cloud providers has been key to both the tremendous success, and complexity, of modern DevOps.

### What is a cloud service provider?
A cloud service provider, or CSP, is a company that offers components of cloud computing -- typically, infrastructure as a service (IaaS), software as a service (SaaS) or platform as a service (PaaS).

Cloud service providers use their own data centers and compute resources to host cloud computing-based infrastructure and platform services for customer organizations. Cloud services typically are priced using various pay-as-you-go subscription models. Customers are charged only for resources they consume, such as the amount of time a service is used or the storage capacity or virtual machines used.

For SaaS products, cloud service providers may host and deliver their own managed services to users. Or they can act as a third party, hosting the app of an independent software vendor.

The most well-known cloud service platforms are Amazon Web Services (AWS), Google Cloud (formerly Google Cloud Platform or GCP) and Microsoft Azure.

### Types of cloud service providers
Customers are purchasing an increasing variety of services from cloud service providers. As mentioned above, the three most common categories of cloud-based services are IaaS, SaaS and PaaS.

1. IaaS providers. In the IaaS model, the cloud service provider delivers infrastructure components that would otherwise exist in an on-premises data center. These components include servers, storage, networking and the virtualization layer, which the IaaS provider hosts in its own data center. CSPs may also complement their IaaS products with services such as monitoring, automation, security, load balancing and storage resiliency.
2. SaaS providers. SaaS vendors offer a variety of business technologies, such as productivity suites, customer relationship management software, human resources management software and data management software, all of which the SaaS vendor hosts and provides over the internet. Many traditional software vendors sell cloud-based versions of their on-premises software products. Some SaaS vendors will contract a third-party cloud provider, while other vendors -- usually larger companies -- will host their own cloud services.
3. PaaS providers. The third type of cloud service provider, PaaS vendors, offers cloud infrastructure and services that users can access to perform various functions. PaaS products are commonly used in software development. In comparison to an IaaS provider, PaaS providers will add more of the application stack, such as operating systems and middleware, to the underlying infrastructure.
