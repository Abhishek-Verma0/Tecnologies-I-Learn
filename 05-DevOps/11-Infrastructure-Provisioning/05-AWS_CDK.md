## AWS CDK
The AWS Cloud Development Kit (AWS CDK) is an open-source software development framework used to provision cloud infrastructure resources in a safe, repeatable manner through AWS CloudFormation. AWS CDK offers the flexibility to write infrastructure as code in popular languages like JavaScript, TypeScript, Python, Java, C#, and Go.

The AWS CDK lets you build reliable, scalable, cost-effective applications in the cloud with the considerable expressive power of a programming language. This approach yields many benefits, including:

- Build with high-level constructs that automatically provide sensible, secure defaults for your AWS resources, defining more infrastructure with less code.

- Use programming idioms like parameters, conditionals, loops, composition, and inheritance to model your system design from building blocks provided by AWS and others.

- Put your infrastructure, application code, and configuration all in one place, ensuring that at every milestone you have a complete, cloud-deployable system.

- Employ software engineering practices such as code reviews, unit tests, and source control to make your infrastructure more robust.

- Connect your AWS resources together (even across stacks) and grant permissions using simple, intent-oriented APIs.

- Import existing AWS CloudFormation templates to give your resources a CDK API.

- Use the power of AWS CloudFormation to perform infrastructure deployments predictably and repeatedly, with rollback on error.

- Easily share infrastructure design patterns among teams within your organization or even with the public.
