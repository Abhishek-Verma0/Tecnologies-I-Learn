## Process Monitoring
A process is an instance of a computer program that is being executed. Each process is identified by a unique number called a process ID (PID). A process is a running program. The operating system tracks processes through the use of process identifiers. A process identifier (PID) is a unique number that identifies a specific process. A PID is automatically assigned to each process when it is created on the system.

There are several linux commands that can be used to monitor processes. The most common ones are:

- ps - report a snapshot of the current processes.
