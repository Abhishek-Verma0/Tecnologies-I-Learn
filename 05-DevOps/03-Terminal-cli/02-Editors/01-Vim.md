Vim is a highly configurable text editor built to make creating and changing any kind of text very efficient. It is included as “vi” with most UNIX systems and with Apple OS X.

Vim ships with vimtutor that is a tutor designed to describe enough of the Vim commands that you will be able to easily use Vim as an all-purpose editor.

Bram Moolenaar created and maintained Vim.

Bram passed away on 3 August 2023 (announcement).
