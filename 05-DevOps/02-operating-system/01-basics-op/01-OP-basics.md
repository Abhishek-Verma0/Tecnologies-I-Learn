## Operating system
An Operating system serves as a bridge between a computer’s user and its hardware. An operating system’s function is to offer a setting in which a user can conveniently and effectively run programmes. In simple terms we can say that and Operating System (OS) is an interface between a computer user and computer hardware. An OS permits software programmes to communicate with a computer’s hardware, The kernel is the name of Piece of software that houses the fundamental elements of Operating System.

## Functionalities of Operating System
1. Resource Management: When parallel accessing happens in the OS means when multiple users are accessing the system the OS works as Resource Manager, Its responsibility is to provide hardware to the user. It decreases the load in the system.
2. Process Management: It includes various tasks like scheduling and termination of the process. It is done with the help of CPU Scheduling algorithms.
3. Storage Management: The file system mechanism used for the management of the storage. NIFS, CIFS, CFS, NFS, etc. are some file systems. All the data is stored in various tracks of Hard disks that are all managed by the storage manager. It included Hard Disk.
4. Memory Management: Refers to the management of primary memory. The operating system has to keep track of how much memory has been used and by whom. It has to decide which process needs memory space and how much. OS also has to allocate and deallocate the memory space.
5. Security/Privacy Management: Privacy is also provided by the Operating system using passwords so that unauthorized applications can’t access programs or data. For example, Windows uses Kerberos authentication to prevent unauthorized access to data.

## Drivers for Specific Hardware Devices
1. Assembler
The input to an assembler is an assembly language program. The output is an object program plus information that enables the loader to prepare the object program for execution. At one time, the computer programmer had at his disposal a basic machine that interpreted, through hardware, certain fundamental instructions. He would program this computer by writing a series of ones and Zeros (Machine language) and placing them into the memory of the machine. Examples of assembly languages include 

2. Compiler and Interpreter

The High-level languages– examples are C, C++, Java, Python, etc (around 300+ famous high-level languages) are processed by compilers and interpreters. A compiler is a program that accepts a source program in a “high-level language “and produces machine code in one go. Some of the compiled languages are FORTRAN, COBOL, C, C++, Rust, and Go. An interpreter is a program that does the same thing but converts high-level code to machine code line-by-line and not all at once.

3. Loader
A Loader is a routine that loads an object program and prepares it for execution. There are various loading schemes: absolute, relocating, and direct-linking. In general, the loader must load, relocate and link the object program. The loader is a program that places programs into memory and prepares them for execution. In a simple loading scheme, the assembler outputs the machine language translation of a program on a secondary device and a loader places it in the core. The loader places into memory the machine language version of the user’s program and transfers control to it.

## Components of an Operating Systems

1. Shell
Shell is the outermost layer of the Operating System and it handles the interaction with the user. The main task of the Shell is the management of interaction between the User and OS. Shell provides better communication with the user and the Operating System Shell does it by giving proper input to the user it also interprets input for the OS and handles the output from the OS. It works as a way of communication between the User and the OS.

2. Kernel
The kernel is one of the components of the Operating System which works as a core component. The rest of the components depends on Kernel for the supply of the important services that are provided by the Operating System. The kernel is the primary interface between the Operating system and Hardware.
### Functions of Kernel
The following functions are to be performed by the Kernel.

- It helps in controlling the System Calls.
- It helps in I/O Management.
- It helps in the management of applications, memory,

### Types of Kernel
There are four types of Kernel that are mentioned below.

1. Monolithic Kernel
2. Microkernel
3. Hybrid Kernel
4. Exokernel
