## Firewall
Firewall is a network security device that monitors and filters incoming and outgoing network traffic based on an organization’s previously established security policies. It is a barrier that sits between a private internal network and the public Internet. A firewall’s main purpose is to allow non-threatening traffic in and to keep dangerous traffic out.

### Types of Firewalls
1. Packet filtering
A small amount of data is analyzed and distributed according to the filter’s standards.

2. Proxy service
Network security system that protects while filtering messages at the application layer.

3. Stateful inspection
Dynamic packet filtering that monitors active connections to determine which network packets to allow through the Firewall.

4. Next Generation Firewall (NGFW)
Deep packet inspection Firewall with application-level inspection.

5. Threat-focused NGFW
These firewalls include all the capabilities of a traditional NGFW and also provide advanced threat detection and remediation. With a threat-focused NGFW you can:

Know which assets are most at risk with complete context awareness
Quickly react to attacks with intelligent security automation that sets policies and hardens your defenses dynamically
Better detect evasive or suspicious activity with network and endpoint event correlation
Greatly decrease the time from detection to cleanup with retrospective security that continuously monitors for suspicious activity and behavior even after initial inspection
Ease administration and reduce complexity with unified policies that protect across the entire attack continuum

6. Virtual firewall
A virtual firewall is typically deployed as a virtual appliance in a private cloud (VMware ESXi, Microsoft Hyper-V, KVM) or public cloud (Amazon Web Services or AWS, Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud Platform or GCP, Oracle Cloud Infrastructure or OCI) to monitor and secure traffic across physical and virtual networks. A virtual firewall is often a key component in software-defined networks (SDN).


7. Cloud Native Firewall
Cloud native firewalls are modernizing the way to secure applications and workload infrastructure at scale. With automated scaling features, cloud native firewalls enable networking operations and security operations teams to run at agile speeds.

Advantages of Cloud Native Firewalls

- Agile and elastic security
- Multi-tenant capability
- Smart load balancing
