## Caching server
A cache server is a dedicated network server or service acting as a server that saves Web pages or other Internet content locally. By placing previously requested information in temporary storage, or cache, a cache server both speeds up access to data and reduces demand on an enterpriseâ€™s bandwidth.

### What is CDN caching?
A CDN, or content delivery network, caches content (such as images, videos, or webpages) in proxy servers that are located closer to end users than origin servers. (A proxy server is a server that receives requests from clients and passes them along to other servers.) Because the servers are closer to the user making the request, a CDN is able to deliver content more quickly.

### What is a CDN cache hit? What is a cache miss?
A cache hit is when a client device makes a request to the cache for content, and the cache has that content saved. A cache miss occurs when the cache does not have the requested content.

A cache hit means that the content will be able to load much more quickly, since the CDN can immediately deliver it to the end user. In the case of a cache miss, a CDN server will pass the request along to the origin server, then cache the content once the origin server responds, so that subsequent requests will result in a cache hit.

### Where are CDN caching servers located?
CDN caching servers are located in data centers all over the globe. Cloudflare has CDN servers in 300 cities spread out throughout the world in order to be as close to end users accessing the content as possible. A location where CDN servers are present is also called a data center.
