React Native is a library built with the same API as React. It uses the same declarative UI paradigm but renders directly to native components. You can write your app once in React and run it on multiple native platforms, like Android and iOS.

While “native” is part of the name, it’s not pure native app development: Expo and React Native still use JavaScript to run your app. Instead of rendering this JavaScript with a web engine, they use the actual native components from the platform.

React Native is a popular open-source framework developed by Facebook for building mobile applications using JavaScript and React. It enables developers to build native mobile apps for iOS and Android platforms using a single codebase, which significantly speeds up development without compromising on the performance and usability of the apps.

With React Native, you write components with JSX, a syntax that combines JavaScript and XML. These components can map to native UI elements like views, text, images, and more.
