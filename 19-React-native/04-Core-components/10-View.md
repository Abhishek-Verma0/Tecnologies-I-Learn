## View
The View component in React Native is a fundamental container component that supports various layout styles. It is the equivalent of a div element in HTML and can be used to create and style containers for various elements. It is a versatile component that can handle various user interactions, including touch events, as well as serving as a decorative and functional piece in your mobile application.

Here’s an example of how to use the View component:
```
import React from 'react';
import { StyleSheet, View, Text } from 'react-native';

function App() {
  return (
    <View style={styles.container}>
      <Text>Hello, World!</Text>
    </View>
  );
}

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  container: {
    flex: 1,
    backgroundColor: '#fff',
    alignItems: 'center',
    justifyContent: 'center',
  },
});

export default App;
```

## SafeAreaView
SafeAreaView is a React Native core component that helps to adjust your app’s UI elements and layout to accommodate the notches, curved edges, or home indicator on iOS devices. It is particularly useful for the iPhone X and newer iPhone models, as it ensures that content is rendered within the visible portion of the screen.

Here is an example of using SafeAreaView in the code:
```
import React from 'react';
import { SafeAreaView, StyleSheet, Text } from 'react-native';

const App = () => {
  return (
    <SafeAreaView style={styles.container}>
      <Text>Hello World!</Text>
    </SafeAreaView>
  );
};

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  container: {
    flex: 1,
  },
});

export default App;
```
In this example, the SafeAreaView component wraps around the content (in this case, a Text component), ensuring that the text is displayed within the safe area of the screen. By using SafeAreaView, you no longer have to worry about placing content outside the visible area or having it obstructed by the notch on iOS devices.

Keep in mind that SafeAreaView only works on iOS devices, and has no effect on Android devices. To handle such cases, you can use platform-specific styles or libraries like react-native-safe-area-context which provide more control and customization options for additional platforms.

## KeyboardAvoidingView
KeyboardAvoidingView is a built-in React Native component that automatically adjusts its children components’ position when the keyboard opens, preventing them from being obscured by the on-screen keyboard. It’s a useful component, particularly for forms and input fields where the user needs to see the text they’re typing.

### Usage
To use the KeyboardAvoidingView, simply wrap the desired components that need to avoid the keyboard with the KeyboardAvoidingView component. The prop behavior is used to specify the type of animating behavior the component will use. This behavior differs depending on the platform and can be one of ‘height’, ‘position’, ‘padding’, or a custom defined behavior.

Here’s a basic example:
```
import React from 'react';
import { View, TextInput, StyleSheet, KeyboardAvoidingView } from 'react-native';

const App = () => {
  return (
    <KeyboardAvoidingView
      style={styles.container}
      behavior="padding" // Additional padding when the keyboard is open.
    >
      <TextInput
        placeholder="Type something here"
        style={styles.textInput}
      />
    </KeyboardAvoidingView>
  );
}

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  container: {
    flex: 1,
    justifyContent: 'center',
  },
  textInput: {
    borderWidth: 1,
    borderColor: 'black',
    padding: 10,
    margin: 20,
  },
});

export default App;
```
