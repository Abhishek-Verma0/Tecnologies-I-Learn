## 1.What are the DRY and DIE principles?

Software developers must not duplicate code according to the DRY principle (Don't Repeat Yourself). Duplicated code can cause maintenance problems as multiple changes must be made. Similar to the DRY principle, DIE (Duplication Is Evil) goes one step further and states that even small amounts of duplication should be avoided.
## 2.Talk about continuous integration and continuous delivery.


Continuous integration and continuous delivery are two interconnected software engineering processes. Continuous integration is a process that takes place in an ongoing manner to ensure that the program is built and tested regularly. Continuous delivery, on the other hand, is the ongoing development process that takes place in the latter part of the program lifecycle just before production.

These two processes form a cohesive automated process that keeps the work on track and increases production speed by getting rid of the inconsistencies between the development and operations teams.
## 3.Explain SQL injection.

An SQL injection can destroy the database by injecting malicious code or hack your database by injecting a hacking code. This occurs because there is little separation between the program code and the user input. SQL injection is a common type of injection attack on databases.

An injection attack can be prevented in the following ways:

- Prepare statements with queries that have defined parameters
- Have pre-defined and stored procedures
- Have a validation process for the input whereby you can blacklist or whitelist the input
- Use the principle of least privilege, i.e. do not provide premium administrator type access to the public database server. So, even if the hacker is able to hack into the application, it would not compromise the integrity of the database as they wouldn’t be able to access it.

## 3.Differentiate between clustered and non-clustered indexes?


A clustered index physically stores the rows on the disk in the order they appear on the index. Thus, only one clustered index is possible. A clustered index tells the database to store values that are close next to one another on the disk.

A non-clustered index has a second list with pointers to the physical rows. There can be several non-clustered indexes, every new index increases the time for writing new records.

If all columns are needed as is, then reading from a Clustered index is faster. You need not go to the index and table in that order. However, if the data must be rearranged, writing to a table with a clustered index can slow down the process.
## 4.What are some common problems with ORMs?

ORMs often have performance issues, incorrect data mapping, and difficulties 
with complex queries.

## 5.What does REST stand for?

Representational States Transfer (REST) is a software architecture that specifies how an API should operate. REST was first created to provide a framework for managing communication on complex networks like the internet.
## 6.What is serialization?

Serialization refers to a process or mechanism that converts the object's state into a byte stream. Deserialization does exactly the opposite. Serializing an object makes it possible to easily convert the byte stream into a copy of the object.

## 7. How do you design a scalable and maintainable RESTful API? What are some best practices, conventions, and tools you would use for documentation and versioning?
To design a scalable and maintainable RESTful API, follow these best practices:

1. Use standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) for CRUD operations.
2. Utilize resource-based URLs with nouns instead of verbs.
3. Implement proper status codes to convey success, failure, or errors.
4. Support filtering, sorting, and pagination for large data sets.
5. Ensure security through authentication and authorization mechanisms like OAuth or JWT.

## 8.Explain the concept of Event-Driven Architecture (EDA) and how it differs from traditional request-response architectures. Why might you choose EDA for a backend system?
Event-Driven Architecture (EDA) is a design paradigm where components communicate through asynchronous events, enabling loose coupling and high scalability. In contrast, traditional request-response architectures involve synchronous communication, with tight coupling between components.

In EDA, producers generate events without knowing or caring about consumers, while consumers react to events without direct interaction with producers. This decoupling allows for flexibility in system evolution and easier maintenance. Additionally, EDA can handle high volumes of real-time data efficiently, as it processes events asynchronously.

Choosing EDA for a backend system may be beneficial when dealing with large-scale applications requiring real-time processing, fault tolerance, and adaptability to changing requirements. It’s particularly suitable for systems with unpredictable workloads, diverse components, or those needing to integrate with other event-driven systems.

## 9. Could you discuss the CAP theorem and its implications for distributed systems? Can you provide examples of databases that prioritize different aspects of the CAP theorem?
The CAP theorem, proposed by Eric Brewer, states that a distributed system can only achieve two out of three properties: Consistency (C), Availability (A), and Partition Tolerance (P). This implies trade-offs when designing distributed systems.

Consistency ensures all nodes have the same data at any given time. Availability guarantees every request receives a response, even if it’s outdated. Partition tolerance means the system continues to function despite network failures.

Databases prioritize different aspects of the CAP theorem based on their use cases:

1. CP databases (e.g., HBase, MongoDB) focus on consistency and partition tolerance, sacrificing availability. They are suitable for applications requiring strong data consistency, such as financial transactions.
2. AP databases (e.g., Cassandra, Riak) prioritize availability and partition tolerance over consistency. These databases fit well with applications where high availability is crucial, like social media platforms or recommendation engines.
3. CA databases (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL) emphasize consistency and availability but lack partition tolerance. They work best in single-node environments or small-scale distributed systems without significant risk of network partitions.
## 10. Explain the difference between ACID and BASE properties in databases. How do these properties impact the choice of a database for a specific application?
ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) and BASE (Basically Available, Soft state, Eventual consistency) properties represent two different approaches to database management. ACID focuses on strong consistency and reliability, while BASE emphasizes availability and scalability.

ACID databases ensure that transactions are processed reliably by following four principles: Atomicity guarantees all-or-nothing execution; Consistency ensures data integrity; Isolation prevents concurrent transactions from affecting each other; Durability confirms committed transactions persist. These properties make ACID databases suitable for applications requiring high levels of data accuracy and consistency, such as financial systems or e-commerce platforms.

BASE databases prioritize availability and partition tolerance over strict consistency. They allow temporary inconsistencies during network partitions or high loads, eventually achieving consistency once the system stabilizes. This approach enables better scalability and performance in distributed environments, making BASE databases ideal for large-scale applications with less stringent consistency requirements, like social media platforms or recommendation engines.

The choice between ACID and BASE depends on an application’s specific needs. If data consistency and reliability are paramount, an ACID-compliant database is appropriate. However, if scalability and availability take precedence, a BASE-oriented database may be more suitable.
## 11.  What are some common caching strategies and techniques you have implemented in backend systems to optimize performance? How do you handle cache invalidation and stale data?
I have implemented various caching strategies in backend systems to optimize performance, including:

1. In-memory caching: Storing frequently accessed data in memory for faster retrieval.
2. Distributed caching: Using tools like Redis or Memcached to store cache across multiple servers, ensuring high availability and scalability.
3. Cache-aside pattern: Loading data into the cache only when it’s requested, reducing unnecessary preloading of unused data.
4. Time-to-live (TTL) based eviction: Setting a predefined expiration time for cached data, preventing stale data from being served.

For cache invalidation and handling stale data, I use techniques such as:

1. Write-through strategy: Updating both cache and database simultaneously, ensuring consistency between them.
2. Event-driven invalidation: Utilizing event listeners to invalidate cache entries upon changes in the underlying data source.
3. Versioning: Assigning version numbers to data objects, allowing clients to request specific versions and detect outdated information.
## 12. What are the most common clauses used with SQL SELECT query?

These SQL clauses are often used with a SELECT statement:

- FROM: specifies the table(s) from which data is retrieved.
- WHERE: filters the records based on certain criteria.
- GROUP BY: groups the records based on certain criteria.
- HAVING: filters the grouped records based on certain criteria.
- ORDER BY: sorts the records in ascending or descending order.
- LIMIT: limits the number of records returned from a query.
- OFFSET: specifies the starting point from which records are returned.
- AS: creates aliases for column names or table names.
- JOIN: combines records from two or more tables.
- UNION: combines the result set of two or more SELECT queries.
## 13.What do you mean by Denormalization?

Denormalization is a technique that is used to access data from higher to lower forms of a database. It assists database managers to improve the efficiency of the whole infrastructure by introducing redundant data into tables. It incorporates redundant data into a table by integrating database queries that integrate data from multiple tables into one table.
## 14.What are Python Modules? Name some Python modules which are most frequently used.
Python modules contain Python code. These codes can be either function classes or variables. A Python module is a .py file that contains executable code.

These are some of the most popular built-in modules:

- os
- sys
- JSON
- math
- random
- data time
## 15. How do you securely store and manage sensitive data, such as user passwords and API keys, in a backend system?
To securely store and manage sensitive data in a backend system, follow these steps:

1. Use encryption: Encrypt sensitive data using strong algorithms like AES-256 before storing it.
2. Hash passwords: Store hashed versions of user passwords with unique salts, employing algorithms such as bcrypt or Argon2.
3. Secure API keys: Store API keys separately from the codebase, using environment variables or dedicated secret management tools like Vault or AWS Secrets Manager.
4. Limit access: Implement role-based access control (RBAC) to restrict who can access sensitive data and enforce the principle of least privilege.
5. Regularly audit: Periodically review and update security measures, ensuring compliance with industry standards and best practices.
6. Monitor for breaches: Set up monitoring and alerting systems to detect unauthorized access attempts and respond promptly.
