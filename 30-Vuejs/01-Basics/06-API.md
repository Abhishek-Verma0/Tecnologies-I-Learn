## API Styles
Up until Vue 2, there was one way to create components in Vue. With Vue 3, a new methodology was introduced called the Composition API. Now, if we want to make a component in Vue, we have two ways to do it. You might be wondering what the difference is, exactly, so letâ€™s take a look at how the newer Composition API differs from the Vue 2 methodology, which is now known as the Options API

## Options API
We use Options API in a Vue application to write and define different components. With this API, we can use options such as data, methods, and mounted.

To state it simply, Options API is an old way to structure a Vue.JS application. Due to some limitations in this API, Composition API was introduced in Vue 3.

## Composition API
With the release of Vue 3, developers now have access to the Composition API, a new way to write Vue components. This API allows features to be grouped together logically, rather than having to organize your single-file components by function. Using the Composition API can lead to more readable code, and gives the developer more flexibility when developing their applications.
