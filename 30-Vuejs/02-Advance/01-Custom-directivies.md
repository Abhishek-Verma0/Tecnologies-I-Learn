## Custom Directives
So far you may have covered two forms of code reuse in Vue: components and composables. Components are the main building blocks, while composables are focused on reusing stateful logic. Custom directives, on the other hand, are mainly intended for reusing logic that involves low-level DOM access on plain elements.

## Custom Events
Sometimes you may need to define custom events that can be used in your components. Vue.js allows you to do this by emitting custom event objects using $emit.
