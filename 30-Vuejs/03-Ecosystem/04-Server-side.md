## Server-side

Server-side rendering refers to the process that the service side completes the HTML structure splicing of the page, sends it to the browser, and then binds the status and events for it to become a fully interactive page.

## Nuxt.js

Nuxt.js is a free and open source JavaScript library based on Vue.js, Node.js, Webpack and Babel.js. Nuxt is inspired by Next.js, which is a framework of similar purpose, based on React.js.

## Static Site Generators

A static site generator is a tool that generates a full static HTML website based on raw data and a set of templates. Essentially, a static site generator automates the task of coding individual HTML pages and gets those pages ready to serve to users ahead of time. Because these HTML pages are pre-built, they can load very quickly in usersâ€™ browsers.
