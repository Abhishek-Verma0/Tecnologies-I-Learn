## State Management

Application state management is the process of maintaining knowledge of an application’s inputs across multiple related data flows that form a complete business transaction — or a session — to understand the condition of the app at any given moment. In computer science, an input is information put into the program by the user and state refers to the condition of an application according to its stored inputs — saved as variables or constants. State can also be described as the collection of preserved information that forms a complete session.

## Pinia

Pinia is a store library for Vue.js, and can be used in Vue 2 and Vue 3, with the same API, except in SSR and its installation. It allows state sharing between pages and components around the application. As the documentation says, it is extensible, intuitive (by organization), has devtools support (in Vue.js devtools), inferred typed state even in javascript and more. In Pinia you can access, mutate, replace, use getters that works like computed, use actions, etc. The library is recommended by the official Vue.js documentation.
