## Routing

Routing is an essential concept in Single Page Applications (SPA). When your application is divided into separated logical sections, and all of them are under their own URL, your users can easily share links among each other.

## Vue Router

Vue Router is the official router for Vue.js which allows creating static/dynamic routes, has support for navigation interception, allows for component based configuration and much more.
