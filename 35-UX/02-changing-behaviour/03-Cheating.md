## Cheating
Cheating, in the context of behavior change strategies, refers to creating shortcuts and loopholes within a designed system, in order to overcome any obstacles users may face while achieving their goals. As a UX designer, you need to understand that users often look for the easiest path to reach their objectives, even if it means bending or breaking the established rules.

### When to use Cheating:
- Overcoming limitations: Allow users to overcome constraints imposed by the system or environment when these limitations prevent them from moving forward in a meaningful way.
- Increasing motivation: When users feel stuck or overwhelmed, cheating mechanisms can help them feel a sense of progress or achievement, thus motivating them to keep going.
- Enhancing user experience: Sometimes, cheating can create fun and engaging experiences, turning ordinary tasks into enjoyable challenges that users might enjoy exploring and exploiting.
### Designing for Cheating:
When designing cheat mechanisms in your UX, consider the following best practices:

- Balance: Cheating should provide an alternative solution without compromising the overall challenge or value offered by the system. Strive for a balance between making tasks easier and avoiding excessive exploitation that could lead to unearned rewards or trivializing the user’s experience.
- Limited Access: Cheating should not become the default behavior or the most commonly used strategy in your design. Limit access or opportunities to cheat to avoid undermining the user’s sense of accomplishment or alienating non-cheating users.
- Documentation and communication: If permitting cheating is an intentional design choice, communicate this to your users explicitly, so they don’t feel guilty about exploiting loopholes. Making users aware of cheat options can help you foster an environment where users knowingly bend the rules, thus adding an interesting dynamic to the overall user experience.
- Monitoring: Constantly monitor how users are interacting with your design and how prevalent cheating behavior is. If cheating becomes too widespread or harmful, consider tweaking the system and addressing any unintended consequences.
## Make it Incidental
In UX design, making something incidental refers to subtly introducing a feature or element while the user is engaged in a different, primary task. The intention behind this approach is to avoid interrupting the user’s flow, prevent them from feeling overwhelmed, and make the discovery of that feature feel more natural and serendipitous.

### Benefits of Making It Incidental
- Less Overwhelming: Users are not bombarded with too much information at once, as an incidental introduction happens when they are already engaged in another task.
- Avoids Distractions: It doesn’t disrupt the flow of the application, allowing users to maintain focus on their original task.
- Increases User Engagement: As users chance upon a feature or element that they possibly need or find useful in the future, this may deepen their connection with the product.
### Techniques to Make it Incidental
- Progressive disclosure: Reveal information or features when relevant, in the context of the user’s current task.
- Guided interactions: Introduce features while users are actively engaged in tasks, where the discovery is an organic part of the interaction.
- Contextual hints: Provide subtle cues or suggestions for users that signal the presence of additional features, which can be used when needed.

## Automate the Act of Repetition
As a UX designer, one of your main goals is to simplify and streamline user interactions. Often, users are required to perform repetitive tasks, which can lead to frustration and decrease efficiency. To enhance the user experience and ensure smooth sailing, it’s essential to reduce or eliminate the need for repeated actions by automating repetitive tasks wherever possible.

### Benefits of Automation
When properly implemented, automation can:

- Save time: By cutting down on repeated actions, users can complete tasks more quickly, increasing productivity.
- Reduce errors: Automating tasks can minimize human error and ensure that actions are completed correctly every time.
- Improve user satisfaction: Reducing tedious tasks can lead to a more positive user experience and increase user retention.
### Strategies for Automation
As a UX designer, consider the following strategies to automate repetitive tasks:

- Pre-fill forms: Auto-fill form fields with the information that the user has entered previously or is likely to enter, such as their name, email address, or phone number. This can save users time and effort in filling out forms.
- Remember user preferences: Store user settings and preferences, such as preferred language, currency, or theme, so that users don’t have to set them again every time they visit your site or app.
- Smart suggestions: Implement predictive text or auto-suggestions based on user input or past behavior. For example, when typing search queries or filling out forms, users may appreciate suggestions to help them complete their task quickly.
- Batch actions: Allow users to perform actions, like selecting or deleting items, in groups rather than individually. This can significantly reduce the number of clicks and time required to complete the task.
- Keyboard shortcuts: Provide keyboard shortcuts for common actions, enabling users to perform tasks without using a mouse or touch interactions. This can be particularly helpful for power users or users with accessibility needs.
