## Salesforce
Salesforce is a cloud platform helping companies to manage relationships with their customers

### A Bit of Salesforce & CRM Background
Customer Relationship Management (CRM) is a technology aimed at improving your company’s relationship and interaction management with customers and potential customers. CRM software helps companies stay connected with their customers, streamline processes, and improve profitability.

Salesforce revolutionized technology and the CRM world in 1999, being one of the first cloud computing companies. What was unique about it? Salesforce started delivering its software through Internet browsers instead of company-hosted servers, thereby reducing building, installation, maintenance, and support costs.

Also, this platform enabled users to access their software from anywhere, not only from the office building. Salesforce also offered a combination of simplicity, scalability, and online accessibility to data from any point on Earth in its software solution, making them an instant hit and a global leader in the market.

### Salesforce Sales Cloud
The Sales Cloud is a CRM platform that was Salesforce’s first and most popular product. This product is designed for the management of your organization’s sales. Originally, this Cloud was created for B2B (Business-to-Business) companies to guide potential customers through a defined sales cycle. However, B2C (Business-to-Consumer) companies can now leverage the Sales Cloud.

Its main built-in objects include:

- Lead (people that expressed an interest in your products or services)
- Account (companies that you want to track)
- Contact (employees of the companies you want to follow)
- Opportunity (potential deals that might result in a new business your sales team believes in)
