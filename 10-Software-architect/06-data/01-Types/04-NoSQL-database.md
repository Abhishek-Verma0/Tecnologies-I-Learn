## Nosql databases
NoSQL databases (aka “not only SQL”) are non-tabular databases and store data differently than relational tables. NoSQL databases come in a variety of types based on their data model. The main types are document, key-value, wide-column, and graph. They provide flexible schemas and scale easily with large amounts of data and high user loads.

### Types of NoSQL databases

1. Document databases Ex. MongoDB
2. Key-value databases Ex. Redis
3. Wide-column databases Ex. Cassandra
4. Graph databases Ex. Neo4J

## NoSQL database features
Each NoSQL database has its own unique features. At a high level, many NoSQL databases have the following features:

1. Flexible schemas
2. Horizontal scaling
3. Fast queries due to the data model
4. Ease of use for developers

## Difference between RDBMS and NoSQL databases
While a variety of differences exist between relational database management systems (RDBMS) and NoSQL databases, one of the key differences is the way the data is modeled in the database. In this section, we'll work through an example of modeling the same data in a relational database and a NoSQL database. Then, we'll highlight some of the other key differences between relational databases and NoSQL databases.
