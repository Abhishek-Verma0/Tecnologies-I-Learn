SQL stands for Structured Query Language. It’s used for relational databases. A SQL database is a collection of tables that stores a specific set of structured data.

Examples of SQL Databases

- MariaDB and MySQL
- PostgreSQL

## Examples of SQL Databases
### MariaDB and MySQL
MariaDB and MySQL are binary compatible open source SQL Database servers that originally started as just MySQL. However due to concerns about the future of MySQL after being acquired by Oracle Software, MariaDB was forked from the project as its own entity but maintains its compatible with MySQL client APIs and protocols in addition to data and table definition files. 

This means that in most cases third party tools will work across both version and can generally be consider a drop-in replacement for either version. With the acquisition of MySQL, Oracle has been a fairly benign steward of the open source project and most of the concerns the community had in the first days of the acquisition have not come to pass, however some open source purists may still prefer MariaDB over MySQL.

### PostgreSQL
PostgreSQL is an object-relational database management system (ORDBMS), instead of a purely RDBMS system like MySQL and MariaDB. This means that PostgreSQL data models can be based on relational database models but can also be object-oriented as well. In practice, that means we see PostgreSQL utilized in more complex and varied data models, while we see MariaDB and MySQL used for more lightweight data models.

Having evolved from the Ingres project at UC Berkley in 1982, PostgreSQL was created with the aim of adding the least number of features required to support all the major data types. This “biggest bang for the buck” mentality has continued to drive the development of PostgreSQL to this day. For the open source purist this is generally the database of choice as it is a true open source project over seen by the PostgreSQL Global Development Group, a not for profit organization that cannot be easily sold due to its formation.
