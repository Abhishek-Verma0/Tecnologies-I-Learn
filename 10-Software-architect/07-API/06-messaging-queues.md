The Business Process Execution Language (BPEL) is a standard industry language. A BPEL process component implements a business process.

A BPEL process implements a potentially long-running service through the use of more elementary services. A BPEL process created in the process editor can perform the following things:

Describe the orchestration of other services using control flow graphs

Use variables to keep the process state

Use sophisticated error handling through fault handling
Support asynchronous events

Correlate inbound requests with the right instance of a particular process

Provide extended transactions through sophisticated compensation support

In addition to these standard BPEL items, there are extensions to BPEL to include people into a process with human task support. For example, you could use a human task extension to add the requirement that a person must approve a loan.
