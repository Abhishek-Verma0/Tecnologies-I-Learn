## BPM: Business Process Management
Medium or large enterprises needs robust processes to streamline their business needs by reducing the cost incurred per process and diminishing the turn around time for each activity. To achieve the above, there are various BPM tools like PEGA, IBM BPM, Appian, etc. Basically these tools automate the processes through a robust process modelling and implementation.

## BPMN: Business Process Management Notations
Its is a standard for representing business processes graphically. While modelling the process, the notations used are complied with BPMN (there are other like EPC, etc.). So BPMN is a standard notation that BPM consultants follow to model the business process. BPMN has versions and now BPMN 2.0 is the standard one.

## BPEL : Business Process Execution Language
Programmers use BPEL to define how a business process that involves web services will be executed. BPEL messages are typically used to invoke remote services, orchestrate process execution and manage events and exceptions. BPEL is often associated with Business Process Management Notation. In many organizations, analysts use BPMN to visualize business processes and developers transform the visualizations to BPEL for execution.

The Business Process Execution Language (BPEL) is a standard industry language. A BPEL process component implements a business process.

A BPEL process implements a potentially long-running service through the use of more elementary services. A BPEL process created in the process editor can perform the following things:
- Describe the orchestration of other services using control flow graphs
- Use variables to keep the process state
- Use sophisticated error handling through fault handling
- Support asynchronous events
- Correlate inbound requests with the right instance of a particular process
- Provide extended transactions through sophisticated compensation support

In addition to these standard BPEL items, there are extensions to BPEL to include people into a process with human task support. For example, you could use a human task extension to add the requirement that a person must approve a loan.
