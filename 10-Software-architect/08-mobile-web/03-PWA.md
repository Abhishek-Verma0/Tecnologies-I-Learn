## PWA
Progressive Web Apps (PWAs) are websites that are progressively enhanced to function like installed, native apps on supporting platforms, while functioning like regular websites on other browsers.

## What is a Progressive Web App?
Progressive Web Applications (PWAs) are apps built with web technologies that we probably all know and love, like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. But they have the feel and functionality of an actual native app. Wait a minute! Native Apps, what do we mean by this?

A Native App is a software application built in a specific programming language for a specific device platform, either IOS or Android.

PWAs are built with the capabilities like push notifications and the ability to work offline. They are also built on and enhanced with modern APIs which makes it easy to deliver improved capabilities along with reliability and the ability to install them on any device.

PWAs takes advantage of the huge web ecosystem this is inclusive of the plugins, and community and the relative ease of deploying and keeping a website contrary to a native application which is pretty difficult to develop. This means you can build a PWA quickly and easily.

With its popularity many companies have shifted into the product, I tend to believe that this is because of its ability to run on an android and iOS without much difference. Some good examples of top companies who have their products as PWAs include: Twitter, Pintrest, Uber, Tiktok, Spotify, Jumia (a leading e-commerce site in Africa) etc...

A common feature about this products is that they are all installable on your home screen, able to work offline from where you last left and offer a comparable experience and features to their native apps.

Just like when building a native mobile app there are some expectations that should be met to make a good product for consumer use, the same thing applies to PWAs. Let's discuss what makes a good PWA.

### Characteristics of PWAs
Below is what should be considered when developing a PWA:

- Responsiveness
Different companies produce gadgets with different screen sizes, and as a developer it's your responsibility to ensure all the different users enjoy the product regardless the device they are using. So it's a good idea to make sure your app can be used on any screen size and it's content is available at any view-port size.

- Installable
Research has shown that users tend to engage more with installed apps compared to visiting the official sites. Having a PWA as your product gives the users the look, feel and engagement of a normal app.

- Independent Connectivity
By keeping a user engaged to your app even while they are offline, provides a more consistent experience than dropping them back to a default offline page.

A good example to illustrate this will be that of a music app, your users should be able to access offline playback and listen to saved music even without internet connection. Another good example is twitter app, a user is able to go back a read through tweets which they might have missed.

- Discoverability
Since most PWAs are converted websites, it is fair to make them discoverable on the search engines, this will help generate extra traffic to your app. This also acts as an advantage over native apps which can't be discovered over the search engines.

- Appearance
The appearance of the app should feel and look like that of a normal app, so be sure to include things like an app icon, this will help make it easily recognizable also things like splash screen will add the touch and feel of an app.

- Cross Platform
PWAs are developed as web app first, which means that they need to work on all browsers/systems and not just a selected few. Users should be able to use them in any browser before they decide to install them.
