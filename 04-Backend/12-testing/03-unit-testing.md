## Unit Testing
Unit testing is where individual units (modules, functions/methods, routines, etc.) of software are tested to ensure their correctness. This low-level testing ensures smaller components are functionally sound while taking the burden off of higher-level tests. Generally, a developer writes these tests during the development process and they are run as automated tests.

### Unit Testing Techniques
The Unit Testing Techniques are mainly categorized into three parts which are Black box testing that involves testing of user interface along with input and output, White box testing that involves testing the functional behaviour of the software application and Gray box testing that is used to execute test suites, test methods, test cases and performing risk analysis.

Code coverage techniques used in Unit Testing are listed below:

- Statement Coverage
- Decision Coverage
- Branch Coverage
- Condition Coverage
- Finite State Machine Coverage

### Unit Testing Tools
There are several automated unit test software available to assist with unit testing. We will provide a few examples below:

1. Junit: Junit is a free to use testing tool used for Java programming language.  It provides assertions to identify test method. This tool test data first and then inserted in the piece of code.
2. NUnit:  NUnit is widely used unit-testing framework use for all .net languages.  It is an open source tool which allows writing scripts manually. It supports data-driven tests which can run in parallel.
3. JMockit:  JMockit is open source Unit testing tool.  It is a code coverage tool with line and path metrics. It allows mocking API with recording and verification syntax. This tool offers Line coverage, Path Coverage, and Data Coverage.
4. EMMA:  EMMA is an open-source toolkit for analyzing and reporting code written in Java language. Emma support coverage types like method, line, basic block. It is Java-based so it is without external library dependencies and can access the source code.
5. PHPUnit: PHPUnit is a unit testing tool for PHP programmer. It takes small portions of code which is called units and test each of them separately.  The tool also allows developers to use pre-define assertion methods to assert that a system behave in a certain manner.
