## Graceful Degradation
Graceful degradation is a design principle that states that a system should be designed to continue functioning, even if some of its components or features are not available. In the context of web development, graceful degradation refers to the ability of a web page or application to continue functioning, even if the user’s browser or device does not support certain features or technologies.

Graceful degradation is often used as an alternative to progressive enhancement, a design principle that states that a system should be designed to take advantage of advanced features and technologies if they are available.

### Getting Started Using Graceful Degradation
Whether you start designing with graceful degradation or using progressive enhancement, designing for maximized accessibility is essential. Getting started with either approach is easy, even with websites you’ve already designed and developed. It begins with identifying which modern features are vital for the user experience; if you remove a feature and it reduces the value or accessibility, it needs a fallback.

Below are some tips to ensure the best approach for your design.

- Write valid, standards-compliant HTML.
- Use external style sheets for your designs and layout.
- Use externally linked scripts for interactivity.
- Ensure the content is accessible even to low-level browsers without CSS or JavaScript.
