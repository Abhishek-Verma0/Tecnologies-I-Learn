Instrumentation refers to the measure of a product’s performance, in order to diagnose errors and to write trace information. Instrumentation can be of two types: source instrumentation and binary instrumentation.

## What Is Backend Monitoring?
Backend monitoring allows the user to view the performance of the infrastructure that is, the components that run a web application. These include the HTTP server, middleware, database, third-party API services, and more.  Each component may have multiple instances (such as multiple HTTP servers), and components can exist in the same data center or in multiple data centers.


Backend monitoring allows the user to view the performance of infrastructure i.e. the components that run a web application. These include the HTTP server, middleware, database, third-party API services, and more.

### What’s Front-End Monitoring?
Front-end monitoring provides a complete view of the performance of your web application from a user’s perspective, including all third-party content.  Front-end monitoring is synonymous with “user experience” or “end-user” monitoring: it paints a picture of what actual users are seeing when they request your website.  Based on a user’s location, browser, connection speed, and a host of other factors, the front-end experience on your site can be radically different.  Front-end monitoring provides visibility into those discrepancies.

While backend monitoring alerts you of failures of your own components, front-end monitoring reveals performance problems that are not necessarily related to component failure.  These include:

- Content problems (i.e., a new image on your site is too heavy, drags down performance; a script served by a site like Facebook is down, thereby slowing down your site)
- Browser-compatibility problems (i.e., users on Firefox 13 are experiencing a much slower page load than users on other browsers)
- Location-based problems (i.e., users in Asia are experiencing a much slower site than users elsewhere)
- Network issues (?last mile? connectivity is a bottleneck, especially on mobile)

## What is telemetry?
Telemetry automatically collects, transmits and measures data from remote sources, using sensors and other devices to collect data. It uses communication systems to transmit the data back to a central location. Subsequently, the data is analyzed to monitor and control the remote system.

Telemetry is the process of continuously collecting data from different components of the application. This data helps engineering teams to troubleshoot issues across services and identify the root causes. In other words, telemetry data powers observability for your distributed applications.
