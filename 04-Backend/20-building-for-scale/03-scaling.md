## What is Scalability?
If you work in the data center industry or any other industry, you will probably hear two terms often referred to as horizontal scaling and vertical scaling, and these are the two most common buzzwords when working with data centers and data center management systems (DMS).

First, letâ€™s explain what scalability is. Scalability is simply measured by the number of requests an application can handle successfully. Once the application can no longer handle any more simultaneous requests, it has reached its scalability limit. There are multiple scaling approaches for businesses in 2020. For example, your application may be able to successfully handle X number of requests simultaneously, but as soon as your application hits X + 1 simultaneous requests, your critical hardware resources run out and your application has reached its maximum capacity.

### Horizontal/Vertical Scaling
Horizontal scaling is a change in the number of a resource. For example, increasing the number of virtual machines processing messages in a queue. Vertical scaling is a change in the size/power of a resource. For example, increasing the memory or disk space available to a machine. Scaling can be applied to databases, cloud resources, and other areas of computing.

### Drawbacks of vertical scaling
Small- and mid-sized companies most often use vertical scaling for their applications because it allows businesses to scale relatively quickly compared to using horizontal scaling. One drawback of vertical scaling is that it poses a higher risk for downtime and outages than horizontal scaling. Correctly provisioning your resources is the best way to ensure that upgrading was worth it and that your business will not experience the negative effects of vertical scaling.
