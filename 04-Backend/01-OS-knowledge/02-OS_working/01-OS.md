### What is an Operating System?
An Operating System (OS) is a software that acts as an interface between computer hardware components and the user. Every computer system must have at least one operating system to run other programs.

### What is Kernel in Operating System?
The kernel is the central component of a computer operating systems. The only job performed by the kernel is to the manage the communication between the software and the hardware. A Kernel is at the nucleus of a computer. It makes the communication between the hardware and software possible. While the Kernel is the innermost part of an operating system, a shell is the outermost one.

### Types of Kernel
There are many types of kernels that exists, but among them, the two most popular kernels are:

1. Monolithic
A monolithic kernel is a single code or block of the program. It provides all the required services offered by the operating system. It is a simplistic design which creates a distinct communication layer between the hardware and software.

2. Microkernels
Microkernel manages all system resources. In this type of kernel, services are implemented in different address space. The user services are stored in user address space, and kernel services are stored under kernel address space. So, it helps to reduce the size of both the kernel and operating system.

### What is Semaphore?
Semaphore is simply a variable that is non-negative and shared between threads. A semaphore is a signaling mechanism, and a thread that is waiting on a semaphore can be signaled by another thread. It uses two atomic operations,
1. Wait
2. Signal for the process synchronization.

### Types of Semaphores

1. Counting Semaphores
This type of Semaphore uses a count that helps task to be acquired or released numerous times. If the initial count = 0, the counting semaphore should be created in the unavailable state.

2. Binary Semaphores
The binary semaphores are quite similar to counting semaphores, but their value is restricted to 0 and 1. In this type of semaphore, the wait operation works only if semaphore = 1, and the signal operation succeeds when semaphore= 0. It is easy to implement than counting semaphores.


### What is Kernel?
A kernel is an important part of an OS that manages system resources. It also acts as a bridge between the software and hardware of the computer. It is one of the first program which is loaded on start-up after the bootloader. The Kernel is also responsible for offering secure access to the machineâ€™s hardware for various programs. It also decides when and how long a certain application uses specific hardware.

### What is Microkernel?
Microkernel is a software or code which contains the required minimum amount of functions, data, and features to implement an operating system. It provides a minimal number of mechanisms, which is good enough to run the most basic functions of an operating system. It allows other parts of the operating system to be implemented as it does not impose a lot of policies.

Microkernels and their user environments are usually implemented in the C++ or C programming languages with a little bit of assembly. However, other implementation languages are possible with some high-level coding.

### What is a Monolithic Kernel?
Monolithic Kernel runs all the basic system services like process management, Memory management, I/O communication, and interrupt handling, file system, etc in kernel space.

### What is File System?
A file is a collection of correlated information which is recorded on secondary or non-volatile storage like magnetic disks, optical disks, and tapes. It is a method of data collection that is used as a medium for giving input and receiving output from that program.

### File Attributes
A file has a name and data. Moreover, it also stores meta information like file creation date and time, current size, last modified date, etc. All this information is called the attributes of a file system.

Here, are some important File attributes used in OS:

- Name: It is the only information stored in a human-readable form.
- Identifier: Every file is identified by a unique tag number within a file system known as an identifier.
- Location: Points to file location on device.
- Type: This attribute is required for systems that support various types of files.
- Size. Attribute used to display the current file size.
- Protection. This attribute assigns and controls the access rights of reading, writing, and executing the file.
- Time, date and security: It is used for protection, security, and also used for monitoring

### What is a Real-Time Operating System (RTOS)?
Real-time operating system (RTOS) is an operating system intended to serve real time application that process data as it comes in, mostly without buffer delay. The full form of RTOS is Real time operating system.

In a RTOS, Processing time requirement are calculated in tenths of seconds increments of time. It is time-bound system that can be defined as fixed time constraints. In this type of system, processing must be done inside the specified constraints. Otherwise, the system will fail.

### Three types of RTOS systems are:

1. Hard Real Time
In Hard RTOS, the deadline is handled very strictly which means that given task must start executing on specified scheduled time, and must be completed within the assigned time duration.

Example: Medical critical care system, Aircraft systems, etc.

2. Firm Real time
These type of RTOS also need to follow the deadlines. However, missing a deadline may not have big impact but could cause undesired affects, like a huge reduction in quality of a product.

Example: Various types of Multimedia applications.

3. Soft Real Time
Soft Real time RTOS, accepts some delays by the Operating system. In this type of RTOS, there is a deadline assigned for a specific job, but a delay for a small amount of time is acceptable. So, deadlines are handled softly by this type of RTOS.

Example: Online Transaction system and Livestock price quotation System.
