InfluxDB was built from the ground up to be a purpose-built time series database; i.e., it was not repurposed to be time series. Time was built-in from the beginning. InfluxDB is part of a comprehensive platform that supports the collection, storage, monitoring, visualization and alerting of time series data. Itâ€™s much more than just a time series database.
