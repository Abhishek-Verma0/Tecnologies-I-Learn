## Microservices
Microservice architecture is a pattern in which highly cohesive, loosely coupled services are separately developed, maintained, and deployed. Each component handles an individual function, and when combined, the application handles an overall business function.

As a result of microservices, service development, testing, problem-solving, deployment, and updating can be done by cross-functional teams independently, leading to faster deployment and troubleshooting. Automation of manual processes and the ability to share the workload reduces the overall development lifecycle.

Application development greatly benefits from the growing popularity of microservices â€” a technique that involves a group of loosely coupled services. Netflix and Amazon are part of the early pioneers of microservices.
