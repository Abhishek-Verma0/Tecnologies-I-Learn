### What is a virtual machine?
A virtual machine (VM) is a technology for stimulating a physical computer. It contains the same components, an operating system (OS), a network interface, and applications. However, it’s sandboxed inside a physical computer.

This means one computer can run multiple VMs and their isolated components. These can be used to develop, stage, and produce the application code. You can build virtualized computing environments with VMs, considered the first generation of cloud computing. 

A virtual machine cannot run without a hypervisor. These lightweight software layers separate VMs and allocate processors, memory, and storage. They’re basically machine monitors that enable multiple operating systems to run simultaneously.

### What is virtualization? How it works
Virtualization refers to the process of using software to create a virtual resource that runs on a layer separate from the physical hardware. The most common use case of virtualization is cloud computing.

You can run several VMs on a computer through virtualization. These VMs are independent systems but share the same physical IT infrastructure and are managed by the hypervisor. 

Virtualization has gained massive prominence in the recent software field. The global application virtualization market is expected to be valued at $5.76 billion by 2026. This is because virtualization allows users to access applications and features without installing them on the computer.

This cloud-based technology saves money, time, and storage space while offering all cloud computing powers. Both large enterprises and small businesses benefit from it. Some of the advantages of virtualization are:

- Availability of all OS resources for apps
- Well-established functionality
- Better security tools and controls
- Robust management tools
- Cost savings and high efficiency
- Centralized workload without overheads
- VirtualBox, VMware Workstation Player, and Microsoft Hyper-V are the most popular VM providers.

### Limitations of virtualization
Virtualization is a powerful technology that has many benefits, but it also has a few limitations that you should be aware of. Some of the main limitations of virtualization include:

It requires significant RAM and CPU resources to run multiple operating systems and a virtual hardware copy.
The shift between private and public clouds and data centers makes the software development lifecycle more complex.
It’s monolithic and runs applications as single, large files.
Adds up computing resources and cycles very quickly.
It doesn’t run some applications properly.
Some older or specialized applications may not be compatible with virtualization software, or may require additional configuration to work properly
Virtualized environments may not be as easy to scale as physical ones, especially when it comes to adding more hardware resources.
### What are containers?
Containers are a means of isolating an application from its surroundings by encapsulating its dependencies and configurations in a single unit. After that, the unit can be shipped to other environments such as private clouds, public clouds, and data centres.

Containers are more lightweight and agile when it comes to virtualizing your environment without a hypervisor. They enable DevOps to concentrate on developing and deploying code, allowing for faster resource provision. A containerized application behaves consistently across development, staging, and production environments.

### What is containerization?
As mentioned earlier, containerization is the process of packaging every component needed to run an application or microservice, including associated libraries. Each container consists of codes, dependencies, and the OS itself. It allows applications to run the same way on multiple platforms.

Containerization is a form of OS virtualization that leverages the features of the host operating system to isolate processes and control their access to memory, disk space, and CPUs. 

The mainstream advent of containerization began with Docker, an open-source platform to build, deploy, and manage containerized applications. With its introduction in 2013, container technology and ecosystem evolved massively.


Some benefits of containerization are:

- Reduced occupancy of IT management resources
- Smaller size requirements
- Faster spin-ups and simplified security updates
- Less code to migrate, transfer, or upload workloads
- Faster delivery
- Easier management
### How does containerization work?
Containerization works by sharing the host OS kernel with other containers as a read-only resource. You can deploy multiple containers on a single server or virtual machine as they’re lightweight and scalable. 
This way, you only maintain one OS and don’t dedicate an entire server to one application. Containerization is the answer to several DevOps problems. This is why several enterprises adopt this approach to migrate managed services to the cloud.

Containers let you break down applications into their smallest components or microservices. These services are developed and deployed independently, eliminating a monolithic unit.

For example, if you support multiple action buttons on your website, the failure of one doesn’t affect the performance of others. This reduces downtime, maintenance pressure, and dependency.

### Limitations of containerization
Like virtual machines, containers also have some limitations.

- All containers must run on similar operating systems.
- If containers are based on a different OS, they need a different host.
- They can create security vulnerabilities in the OS kernel as all containers on the host machine share the OS.
- This solution is still developing and improving, so it can be more complicated to adopt.
