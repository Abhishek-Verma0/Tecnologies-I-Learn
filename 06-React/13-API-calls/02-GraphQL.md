## urql
urql (Universal React Query Library) is a library for managing GraphQL data in React applications. It is developed and maintained by Formidable Labs and is available as open-source software.

urql is designed to be easy to use and flexible, with a simple API for performing GraphQL queries and mutations. It is based on the concept of a client, which is used to manage the GraphQL data for an application. The client provides a set of utilities and APIs for managing GraphQL data, including:

executeQuery: A utility for executing a GraphQL query.
executeMutation: A utility for executing a GraphQL mutation.
useQuery: A hook for executing a GraphQL query and accessing the result in a component.
useMutation: A hook for executing a GraphQL mutation and accessing the result in a component.
urql is often used as an alternative to other GraphQL libraries, such as Apollo Client, because of its simplicity and lightweight size. It is particularly well-suited for small to medium-sized React applications where the complexity of other GraphQL libraries may not be required.

## Relay
Relay is a JavaScript client used in the browser to fetch GraphQL data. Itâ€™s a JavaScript framework developed by Facebook for managing and fetching data in React applications. It is built with scalability in mind in order to power complex applications like Facebook. The ultimate goal of GraphQL and Relay is to deliver instant UI-response interactions.

## Apollo
Apollo is a platform for building a unified graph, a communication layer that helps you manage the flow of data between your application clients (such as web and native apps) and your back-end services.
