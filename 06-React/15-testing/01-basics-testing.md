## Testing
A key to building software that meets requirements without defects is testing. Software testing helps developers know they are building the right software. When tests are run as part of the development process (often with continuous integration tools), they build confidence and prevent regressions in the code.

### The different levels of a Test Automation Pyramid
This test automation pyramid or a testing pyramid operates through three levels:

- Unit Tests
- Integration Tests
- End-to-End Tests

## Jest
Jest is a delightful JavaScript Testing Framework with a focus on simplicity. It works with projects using: Babel, TypeScript, Node, React, Angular, Vue and more!
[docs](https://jestjs.io/)

## React Testing Library
The React Testing Library is a very lightweight solution for testing React components. It provides light utility functions on top of react-dom and react-dom/test-utils, in a way that encourages better testing practices. Its primary guiding principle is: The more your tests resemble the way your software is used, the more confidence they can give you.

## Cypress
Cypress framework is a JavaScript-based end-to-end testing framework built on top of Mocha â€“ a feature-rich JavaScript test framework running on and in the browser, making asynchronous testing simple and convenient. It also uses a BDD/TDD assertion library and a browser to pair with any JavaScript testing framework.
