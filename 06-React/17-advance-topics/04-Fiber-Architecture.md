## Fiber Architecture
React 16.0 was released with an update to the React core algorithm. This new core architecture is named “Fiber.” Facebook has completely rewritten the internals of React from the ground-up while keeping the public API essentially unchanged; in simple terms, it means only changing the engine of a running car.
