## What is a Row?
A row in PostgreSQL represents a single, uniquely identifiable record with a specific set of fields in a table. Each row in a table is made up of one or more columns, where each column can store a specific type of data (e.g., integer, character, date, etc.). The structure of a table determines the schema of its rows, and each row in a table must adhere to this schema.

## Row Operations
You can perform various operations on rows in PostgreSQL:

- Insert - Add a new row to a table:
```
INSERT INTO table_name (column1, column2, column3, ...)
VALUES (value1, value2, value3, ...);
```
- Select - Retrieve specific rows from a table:
```
SELECT * FROM table_name
WHERE condition;
```
- Update - Modify an existing row:
```
UPDATE table_name
SET column1 = value1, column2 = value2, ...
WHERE condition;
```
- Delete - Remove a row from a table:
```
DELETE FROM table_name
WHERE condition;
```
### Examples
Consider the following table named employees:

id	name	age	department
1	John	30	HR
2	Alice	25	IT
3	Bob	28	Finance

- Insert a new row:
```
INSERT INTO employees (id, name, age, department)
VALUES (4, 'Eve', 32, 'IT');
```
- Retrieve rows where department is ‘IT’:
```
SELECT * FROM employees
WHERE department = 'IT';
```
- Update the age of an employee:
```
UPDATE employees
SET age = 31
WHERE name = 'John';
```
- Delete a row for an employee:
```
DELETE FROM employees
WHERE id = 3;
```
