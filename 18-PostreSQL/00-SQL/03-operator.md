## Operators
SQL operators are used to perform operations like comparisons and arithmetic calculations. They are very crucial in forming queries. SQL operators are divided into the following types:

1. Arithmetic Operators: These are used to perform mathematical operations. Here is a list of these operators:

- (+) : Addition
- (-) : Subtraction
- (*) : Multiplication
- (/) : Division
- (%) : Modulus


2. Comparison Operators: These are used in the where clause to compare one expression with another. Some of these operators are:

- (=) : Equal
- != or <> : Not equal
- (>) : Greater than
- < : Less than
- (>=): Greater than or equal
- (<=): Less than or equal


3. Logical Operators: They are used to combine the result set of two different component conditions. These include:

- AND: Returns true if both components are true.
- OR : Returns true if any one of the component is true.
- NOT: Returns the opposite boolean value of the condition.

4. Bitwise Operators: These perform bit-level operations on the inputs. Here is a list of these operators:

- & : Bitwise AND
- | : Bitwise OR
- ^ : Bitwise XOR

Bitwise operators are much less commonly used in SQL than the other types of operators.
