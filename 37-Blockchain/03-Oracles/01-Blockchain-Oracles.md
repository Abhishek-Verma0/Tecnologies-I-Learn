A blockchain oracle is a third-party service that connects smart contracts with the outside world, primarily to feed information in from the world, but also the reverse. Information from the world encapsulates multiple sources so that decentralized knowledge is obtained.

## What Is an Oracle Network?

Oracles provide a way for the decentralized Web3 ecosystem to access existing data sources, legacy systems, and advanced computations. Decentralized oracle networks (DONs) enable the creation of hybrid smart contracts, where onchain code and offchain infrastructure are combined to support advanced decentralized applications (dApps) that react to real-world events and interoperate with traditional systems.

## Types of Blockchain Oracles

Given the extensive range of offchain resources, blockchain oracles come in many shapes and sizes. Not only do hybrid smart contracts need various types of external data and computation, but they require various mechanisms for delivery and different levels of security. Generally, each type of crypto oracle involves some combination of fetching, validating, computing upon, and delivering data to a destination.

### Input Oracles

The most widely recognized type of oracle today is known as an “input oracle,” which fetches data from the real-world (offchain) and delivers it onto a blockchain network for smart contract consumption. These types of oracles are used to power Chainlink Price Feeds, providing DeFi smart contracts with onchain access to financial market data.

### Output Oracles

The opposite of input oracles are “output oracles,” which allow smart contracts to send commands to offchain systems that trigger them to execute certain actions. This can include informing a banking network to make a payment, telling a storage provider to store the supplied data, or pinging an IoT system to unlock a car door once the onchain rental payment is made.

### Cross-Chain Oracles

Another type of oracle are cross-chain oracles that can read and write information between different blockchains. Cross-chain oracles enable interoperability for moving both data and assets between blockchains, such as using data on one blockchain to trigger an action on another or bridging assets cross-chain so they can be used outside the native blockchain they were issued on.

### Compute-Enabled Oracles

A new type of oracle becoming more widely used by smart contract applications are “compute-enabled oracles,” which use secure offchain computation to provide decentralized services that are impractical to do onchain due to technical, legal, or financial constraints. This can include using Chainlink Automation to trigger the running of smart contracts when predefined events take place, computing zero-knowledge proofs to generate data privacy, or running a verifiable randomness function to provide a tamper-proof and provably fair source of randomness to smart contracts.
