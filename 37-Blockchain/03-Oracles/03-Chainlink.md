## Chainlink
Chainlink is a decentralized network of oracles that enables smart contracts to securely interact with real-world data and services that exist outside of blockchain networks.

## Chainlink Oracles Bridge the On- and Off-Chain Chasm
This is where oracles come into play. An oracle is software known as ‘middleware’ that acts as an intermediary, translating data from the real world to smart contracts on the blockchain and back again.

However, a single centralized oracle creates the very problem a decentralized, blockchain-secured smart contract aims to solve — a central point of weakness. If the oracle is faulty or compromised, how would you know if your data is accurate? What good is a secure, trustworthy smart contract on the blockchain if the data that feeds it is in question?

So, let’s do a quick recap on smart contracts and oracles:

Smart contracts are immutable and verifiable contracts that automatically execute in an IF/THEN framework when conditions are met.

The data that defines these conditions has traditionally come from the blockchain.

Recently, oracles have been introduced into the crypto ecosystem to bring off-chain data to on-chain smart contracts.

But, centralized oracles diminish the benefits of on-blockchain smart contracts because they may be untrustworthy or faulty.

Chainlink is a decentralized network of nodes that provide data and information from off-blockchain sources to on-blockchain smart contracts via oracles.

This process, along with extra secure hardware, eliminates the reliability issues that might occur if using only a single centralized source.
