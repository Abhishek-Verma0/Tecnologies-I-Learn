## Programming Languages
Smart contracts can be programmed using relatively developer-friendly languages. If you’re experienced with Python or any curly-bracket language, you can find a language with familiar syntax.

## SOLIDITY
- Object-oriented, high-level language for implementing smart contracts.
-  Curly-bracket language that has been most profoundly influenced by C++.
- Statically typed (the type of a variable is known at compile time).
Supports:
- Inheritance (you can extend other contracts).
- Libraries (you can create reusable code that you can call from different contracts – like static functions in a static class in other object oriented programming languages).
- Complex user-defined types.

## VYPER
- Pythonic programming language
- Strong typing
- Small and understandable compiler code
- Efficient bytecode generation
- Deliberately has less features than Solidity with the aim of making contracts more secure and easier to audit. Vyper does not support:
- Modifiers
- Inheritance
- Inline assembly
- Function overloading
- Operator overloading
- Recursive calling
- Infinite-length loops
- Binary fixed points

## Rust
Rust is a multi-paradigm, general-purpose programming language. Rust emphasizes performance, type safety, and concurrency. It is popular on smart contract chains Solana and Polkadot.
