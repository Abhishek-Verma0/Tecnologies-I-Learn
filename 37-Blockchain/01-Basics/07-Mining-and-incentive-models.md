## Mining and incentive models
Mining is the process of adding transaction details to the Blockchain, like sender address, hash value, etc. The Blockchain contains all the history of the transactions that have taken place in the past for record purposes and it is stored in such a manner that, it canâ€™t be manipulated.

An Incentive is basically a reward given to a Blockchain Miner for speeding up the transactions and making correct decisions while processing the complete transaction securely.

Bitcoin Mining works in the following ways:

- Mining needs high computational power and resources to solve difficult mathematical algorithms in order to add the transaction records successfully to the Blockchain.
- The process of discovering a new Bitcoin is simply called Mining and Miners tend to find new Bitcoins by solving difficult and complex algorithms.
- Each Miner across the world uses the computational resources and power he has to process the transactions and add the records to the Blockchain. Bitcoin is designed by its creator to mine every new Bitcoin every 10 minutes.
- Since all Bitcoin Miners contribute their computational power for processing the transactions, they get a reward in return. All those Miners who solve the complex algorithms are awarded in terms of Bitcoin digital currency.
