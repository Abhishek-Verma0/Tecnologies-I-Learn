## Blockchain interoperability
The concept of “blockchain interoperability” refers to the ability of different blockchain networks to exchange and leverage data between one another and to move unique types of digital assets between the networks’ respective blockchains

### Blockchain Interoperability Projects
Given the ever-growing need to enhance the connection between various blockchain networks, many developers are already working on optimal solutions. The number of blockchain interoperability projects is on the rise as a result as developers look to accelerate blockchain mass adoption.

Below are some of the top projects, looking to enhance blockchain interoperability.

- Polkadot blockchain
Polkadot blockchain is a high-profile multi-chain technology taking blockchain interoperability to another level. A brainchild of Gavid Wood, one of the founders of Ethereum, Polkadot seeks to enhance the transfer of smart contract data through various blockchains.

Polkadot consists of multiple parachains that differ in characteristics. In Polkadot blockchain, transactions can be spread over a wide area given the number of chains in the network. All this is done while ensuring high levels of security on dealings.

Polkadot Blockchain interoperability project seeks to ensure a seamless connection between private chains, public networks, oracles as well as permission less interface. The developers behind the blockchain interoperability solutions want to enable an internet where independent blockchain solutions will be able to exchange information via a Polkadot relay chain.

The fundamental tenets of the blockchain interoperability solutions are scalability as well as governance.

- Blocknet
Developers behind Blocknet are currently working on creating a decentralized exchange all in the effort of enhancing interchange communication.

Blockchain is also implementing blockchain interoperability strategies that can change the way we see blockchain at the moment.

What Blocknet intends to do is decentralize all the four components all in the effort of creating the first Decentralized exchange. The project backers are also working on optimizing the cross-chain platform to serve as infrastructure.

- Aion Online
Aion online is another high profile Blockchain interoperability project that seeks to address unresolved questions around scalability and interoperability in blockchain networks. Developers are planning to position Aion as the standard protocol used by various blockchains. The end game is to enhance the creation of efficient and decentralized systems.

The developers have already come up with a federated blockchain network that makes it possible to integrate disparate blockchain systems in multi-tier hub.

- Wanchain
Wanchain casts itself as the world’s first online blockchain interoperable blockchain solution, with secure multi-party computing. More so, the blockchain interoperability solution seeks to rebuild finance by housing all digital assets on one blockchain.

They are introducing one of the unique blockchain interoperability strategies at the moment.

The blockchain interoperability project ensures cross-chain capabilities by leveraging the latest research in cryptographic theories. It also relies on a proprietary protocol that allows interconnection of private, public and consortium chains. The interconnection makes it easy to transfer digital assets between two different blockchains.

Based on Ethereum, Wanchain blockchain also enables the deployment of smart contracts. All these aspects make it a compelling blockchain solution for delivering distributed applications that require easy access to different blockchains. Privacy on the blockchain is enhanced by the use of Ring signatures as well as one-time stealth addresses.

- Cosmos Blockchain
Cosmos blockchain is the most underrated blockchain interoperability project. The blockchain project is in the race to become the hub of many projects. The developers have since released a software development kit that they say will address scalability and interoperability issues in blockchain projects.

Cosmos blockchain architecture consists of several independent blockchains called Zones, attached to a central blockchain dubbed as the Hub. Tendermint Core that enables high-performance as well as consistent and secure PBFT-like consensus engine, powers each Zone in this case.

The cosmos Hub connects blockchain projects to enhance interoperability via the Inter-Blockchain communication protocol.

Because of the interconnection, people can send tokens from one zone to another in real time and securely, without engaging the services of a third party. Cosmos blockchain can connect different zones from public to private project thanks to the IBC connection.
